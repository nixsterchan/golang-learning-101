# Golang Learning Repository

This repository serves as a personal collection of Go (Golang) code that I’ve written while learning the language. It includes code snippets, test files, and exercises completed as part of various beginner-friendly courses and resources.

The purpose of this repo is purely educational — to help me track my progress and consolidate what I’ve learned.

## Index
